# Writing Docstrings Study

This repository is part of a research study on how AI-assisted explanations affect understanding of unfamiliar programming languages. You will complete two short tasks by writing explanations (as docstrings or comments) for C++ functions.

> 🔒 To stay anonymous, do not include your name, email address, or GitHub username anywhere in your submission. Use only your assigned Participant ID (e.g., `P001`).

## 📥 How to Begin

1. Download the files in this repository:
   - `task_a.cpp`
   - `task_b.cpp`

You can download them individually or as a ZIP by clicking the green **Code** button and selecting **Download ZIP**.

---

## Tasks
You are expected to write docstrings for functions in both tasks. The docstrings should have the following information:
1. Purpose of the Function: What the function does in plain English.
2. Parameters: What inputs the function takes, including:
   - Data types
   - What each parameter represents
5. Return Value: What the function returns, its type, and meaning (if any).
6. Side Effects: Any changes made outside the function (e.g., printing to console).
7. Special/Edge Cases: Any assumptions, constraints, or edge behavior.
8. Brief Example (optional): A quick usage example for context.


## 🧪 Task A – With GitHub Copilot (10 minutes)

- Open the file `task_a.cpp`.
- Use **GitHub Copilot** to help you generate explanations (as comments or docstrings).
- You may accept or modify Copilot’s suggestions.
- You have 10 minutes to complete this task.

---

## 🧪 Task B – Without Copilot (15 minutes)

- Open the file `task_b.cpp`.
- Do **not** use Copilot or any AI assistance.
- Write your explanation based only on your own understanding.
- You have 15 minutes to complete this task.

---

## 📤 Submit Your Work

1. Zip the modified files:
   - Include both `task_a.cpp` and `task_b.cpp`
   - Name the zip file: `P001-docstring-study.zip` (replace `P001` with your Participant ID)

2. Go to: https://www.file.io
3. Upload your zipped folder (e.g., `P001-docstring-study.zip`)
4. If available, check "Allow multiple downloads"
5. Copy the download link, this will be uploaded in your reflection form.

6. Then complete the reflection form:

## ❗ Reminders

- Do **not** include your name, email, or GitHub username in the files.
- Use only your assigned Participant ID.
- Stick to the time limits: 10 minutes for Task A, 15 minutes for Task B.
- Do not modify anything outside the `.cpp` files.
- Do not modify the actual code. 
- If you have technical issues (e.g., cannot open a file), contact the researcher. No help will be provided for understanding the code.
